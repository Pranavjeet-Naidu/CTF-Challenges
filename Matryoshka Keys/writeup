### Write-Up of the Solution (Solver’s Perspective)

**Challenge Setup and Initial Observations**

Upon examining the challenge, I was given the following parameters:

- Two sets of ECC keys (private and public) for me and my peer.
- Encrypted data (ciphertext), an authentication tag, a nonce, and two salts.
  
The goal was to decrypt the ciphertext using the provided cryptographic data. Seeing the private key in plaintext was unexpected, as that’s typically not something that’s shared in secure setups. But it hinted that the focus here would be more about correctly applying cryptographic methods rather than deriving unknown keys.

**Step 1: Loading the Private and Public Keys**

The first task was to load the keys using Python's `cryptography` library. By importing the private key and the peer's public key, I prepared for an ECDH key exchange. 

```python
private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
    private_key_pem.encode(),
    password=None
)
peer_public_key = serialization.load_pem_public_key(
    peer_public_key_pem.encode()
)
```

These loaded keys would enable me to generate a shared secret.

---

**Step 2: ECDH Shared Secret Generation**

Using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and the loaded keys, I generated a shared secret. This secret is typically unique to the key pair, making it suitable as the basis for further derivations:

```python
shared_secret = private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key)
```

This shared secret was crucial as it’s the starting point for building the symmetric key that would later decrypt the message.

**Step 3: Converting Hex to Bytes**

To work with the ciphertext, tag, nonce, and salts, I converted each from hex to bytes. This conversion was straightforward, using Python’s `bytes.fromhex()` method, but critical for ensuring all inputs were in the correct format.

---

**Step 4: Key Derivation with HKDF**

The first Key Derivation Function (KDF) step involved HKDF, which refines the shared secret with `salt1` into an intermediate key:

```python
hkdf = HKDF(
    algorithm=SHA256(),
    length=32,
    salt=salt1,
    info=b"challenge",
)
intermediate_key = hkdf.derive(shared_secret)
```

HKDF helped structure the shared secret into a standardized form, priming it for further derivation.

---

**Step 5: Key Derivation with PBKDF2**

Next, I applied PBKDF2 to the intermediate key using `salt2` and set a high iteration count for additional strengthening:

```python
pbkdf2 = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=SHA256(),
    length=32,
    salt=salt2,
    iterations=100_000,
)
final_key = pbkdf2.derive(intermediate_key)
```

The final key was the output of this step, refined and ready for use in decryption.

---

**Step 6: Decryption with XChaCha20-Poly1305**

With the derived key, I initialized XChaCha20-Poly1305 for decryption. Using the nonce, tag, and ciphertext, I attempted to decrypt the message:

```python
chacha = XChaCha20_Poly1305.new(key=final_key, nonce=nonce)
plaintext = chacha.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
```

The decryption succeeded, revealing the plaintext message. The tag verification step confirmed the integrity of the data, assuring me that the encryption and decryption process were consistent.

**Reflection**

Completing this challenge was rewarding because it covered a wide array of cryptographic concepts—from key exchange and KDF chaining to authenticated decryption. Each step was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of cryptographic workflows. Sharing the private key initially felt like a simplification, but it allowed me to focus on mastering key derivation and encryption methods without getting lost in key recovery.

This challenge emphasized how crucial precision is in cryptography: a small error in derivation or formatting could lead to failure, but successfully applying each step revealed the secret message, making it a satisfying solve.
